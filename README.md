# Project Title

Training LLaMA 3.2 Vision for Image Description

## Description

This project involves training the LLaMA 3.2 Vision model to describe given images. The model is fine-tuned on a sample dataset ([0:500]) for 3 epochs to generate accurate and meaningful image descriptions.

## Features

- Leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models.
- Supports dataset integration via Hugging Face Datasets.
- Provides reinforcement learning capabilities with `trl`.
- Includes utilities for model fine-tuning and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `transformers` (Hugging Face Transformers)
- `datasets` (Hugging Face Datasets)
- `trl` (Transformers Reinforcement Learning)
- `huggingface_hub` (Hugging Face Hub integration)
- `unsloth` (Custom or third-party library; ensure it is installed)
- `os` (standard Python library; pre-installed with Python)

Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets trl huggingface_hub unsloth
```

## Dataset

This project uses the following dataset:

- [Amazon Product Descriptions VLM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/philschmid/amazon-product-descriptions-vlm)

## Trained Model

The trained model can be accessed here:

- [LLaMA 3.2 Vision - Amazon Product](https://huggingface.co/aesat/llama_3.2_vision_amazon_product)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook llama3.2_vision.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the code and train the model on the sample dataset.

4. The training process involves:
   - Using the dataset indices [0:500].
   - Running for 3 epochs.

## File Structure

- `llama3.2_vision.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the implementation for training and evaluating the LLaMA 3.2 Vision model.

## Notes

- Ensure you have access to the Hugging Face API if required by the notebook.
- Review the code to customize parameters such as dataset paths, model names, and training configurations.
- Modify the dataset range or number of epochs based on your requirements.
